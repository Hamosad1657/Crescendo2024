/**
 * Modify the setpoint to always go the shorter way when controlling position on a circle.
 * The output of this function changes according to the measurement, so it must be updated every
 * loop iteration.
 *
 * Returns a new setpoint that will produce the shortest path to [realSetpoint], using the
 * [measurement] (which isn't required to be inside of [minPossibleSetpoint] and [maxPossibleSetpoint]).
 *
 * The [minPossibleSetpoint] and [maxPossibleSetpoint] define the range where the wrapping will occur.
 *
 * # Example
 * Say I want to control the angle of a swerve module (we'll use degrees for convenience).
 * Zero and 360 are the same position in reality, and it can cross this position with no
 * problem physically. The PID runs onboard the motor controller, not the RoboRIO.
 *
 * Now, imagine this situation: The wheel is now at 10 degrees, and the setpoint is 350.
 * Without this function, the motor will move 340 degrees all the way around, even though in
 * reality it's only 20 degrees away, because it does not know that zero and 360 are the same.
 *
 * ||||| To solve the above problem, use this function! pass 350.0 for [realSetpoint], 10.0 for
 * [measurement], 0.0 for [minPossibleSetpoint], and 360.0 for [maxPossibleSetpoint].
 * This function will return a new setpoint in degrees, which is then set to the motor controller
 * in position control mode (you convert units if needed, this function is not responsible for unit
 * conversions) and the new setpoint will make it go the shorter way.
 *
 * - Note that the measurement is allowed to accumulate beyond [minPossibleSetpoint] and
 * [maxPossibleSetpoint], but it needs to correspond to the same position in the original scope.
 * For example, a measurement of 361 must be the same module angle as measurement 1.
 *
 * * Note that the new setpoint returned is NOT "set and forget": it changes according to the
 * measurement and therefore must be updated every loop iteration. (Which you have to do anyway
 * if you use WPILib's motor safety stuff.)
 *
 * - DO NOT use this function if your mechanism cannot move freely in every direction, like
 * in a turret with finite rotation. Also don't use it for controlling linear motion, like
 * a telescopic arm or an elevator.
 *
 * * This function is not needed with a Spark Max motor controller, because it already does this.
 * It's also not needed with WPILib's PIDController, since it has ```enableContinuousInput().```
